            <li>Personal Comments: This is my first project in C++. This is back when I was still actively interested in Game Development so unfortunately, it's still very rough around the edges.

            <li>Personal Comments: This is originally just a task that I was given in my OOP class but I was intrigued by it and I decided to develop it further and combine it with my love for Pokemon.
